//create your routes here

// 1. Add a GET route for /signup . 
// Show the signup.hbs file when the user visits that route


// 2. Add a GET route for /signin . 
// Show the signin.hbs file when the user visits that route


// 3. don't forget to export your router with 'modeul.exports'



// And finally don't forget to link this router in your middleware at the bottom of app.js where the other routes are defined
